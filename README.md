# What is this?
This is basically just a PHP script that just echoes an image unless a correct password is given, only then does it list files.
# How do I use it?
Make a folder on your server that ends with a file type such as PNG, JPG, GIF, etc and set it in `index.php`. Also please don't forget to change your password! Also please deny directory listings on your server if you wish to keep your files private or Deny from all in a .htaccess file.
